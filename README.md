Analysis Summary
The analysis in the Jupyter Notebook covers the following:
1. Data Loading and Inspection:
o Reading the dataset.
o Inspecting the first few rows of the dataset.
o Checking for missing values and basic data cleaning.
2. Descriptive Statistics:
o Calculating and interpreting measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
o Calculating and interpreting measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range).
o Identifying outliers using z-scores and visualizing them.
3. Visualizations:
o Plotting histograms and box plots for continuous variables.
o Plotting bar charts for categorical variables.
4. Insights and Conclusions:
