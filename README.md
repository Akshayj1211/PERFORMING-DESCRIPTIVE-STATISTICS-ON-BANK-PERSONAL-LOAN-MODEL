* Inspecting the first few rows of the dataset.
* Checking for missing values and basic data cleaning.

2. Descriptive Statistics:
* Calculating and interpreting measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
* Calculating and interpreting measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range).
* Identifying outliers using z-scores and visualizing them.
3. Visualizations:
